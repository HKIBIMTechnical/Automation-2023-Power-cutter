## Overview

In typical BIM modelling workflows, construction managers and structural engineers often request numerous modifications to structural elements and the extraction of different data, such as concrete volume and quantity. Unfortunately, Revit does not offer a batch operation function to process modifications simultaneously, making it a time - consuming and challenging task for modellers.

To overcome this issue, Power Cutter simplifies the split element process for all users, including site foremen, structural engineers, managers, and more. The tool aims to help the user more easily utilize the BIM model to generate desired results.
